# Dummy food-delivery web app

Next exercise to master React, focused on using new features learned.

Goals

    from scratch without any CSS lib (main goal is learning React, so as first example I added some rude css)

    build an easy (front-end) web app to order food  

    use different 'new' hooks learned (in particular use of custom context)

Tools/lib/frameworks

    react
